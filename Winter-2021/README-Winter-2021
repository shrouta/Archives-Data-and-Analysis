# Archives, Data and Analysis Winter 2021 Course Notebooks

In the Winter term of 2021, Bates courses were divided into two seven-week modules.  These are the course materials that I designed for the modular version of the course.

They include:
* Six code-writing worksheets: exercizes that students undertook outside of class to practice R and data analysis skills
* The course syllabus
