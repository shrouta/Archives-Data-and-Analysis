# Archives-Data-and-Analysis
Course materials for DCS204: Archives, Data and Analysis at Bates College

Data is not neutral. Data is not naturally-occurring. Data is made, processed and analyzed by people. Data enacts power.  Understanding the different cultural frameworks in which data operates helps us to more thoughtfully engage with it and makes our analyses more powerful.  

This class provides an opportunity for students to immerse themselves in a module-long project in digital environments, moving from ‘analog’ archives, through data structuring, and quantitative analysis, and culminating with a public-facing data project.
## Learning Goals and Objectives:
Learning goals are the higher order ambitions that I have for this class.  Learning objectives are specific, measurable competencies which indicate that the learning goals have been met.  

I am including both here, so that you have a sense of why we are doing the work that we are in this class.

### Learning Goals:
Explain how datasets are constructed, and how their construction leads to subjective representations of the world.
Develop a framework for predicting how different ways of structuring data will help or hinder analyses.
Understand how programming languages can be used to manipulate, analyze and visualize data, keeping in mind the subjectivity of that data.
Translate your learning and the work of the class into informed civic action in pursuit of social justice and responsible stewardship of the wider world.
Differentiate between different approaches to the study of data and digital humanities.

### Learning Objectives:
Build a dataset that represents the early financial history of Bates College, and the relationship between the college and the American slave economy.
Read and write code that manipulates, visualizes and analyzes data using the programming language R.
Create and curate an online presence that presents the work of the class to audiences beyond Bates.
Become conversant with scholarly work on data science, quantitative analysis, digital humanities and related fields

## Usage:
I'm sharing some course materials here that might be of interest to folks developing courses in the computational humanities, humanities + data analysis, or other digital studies/humanities areas.

I'm happy for these to be remixed and reused, but if you adapt them lightly for a course, please let me know (at <ashrout@bates.edu>) so that I can see where they end up!
